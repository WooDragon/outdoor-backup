# ShellCheck configuration for OpenWrt outdoor-backup project
# OpenWrt uses BusyBox ash, which supports bash-like features (FD >9, string indexing)

# Use bash shell dialect (BusyBox ash is closer to bash than dash)
# ash mode is too strict (dash-based), fails on valid BusyBox ash code
shell=bash

# Disable false positives for OpenWrt environment
disable=SC2034  # Variables like START/STOP/USE_PROCD appear unused but are used by OpenWrt init system
disable=SC1090  # Can't follow non-constant source (common pattern in OpenWrt scripts)
disable=SC1091  # Not following sourced files (common.sh uses dynamic paths)
